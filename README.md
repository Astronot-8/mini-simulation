# Particle Simulation

## Overview

**This project is a particle simulation** created in Visual Studio 2022, utilizing the C++ programming language and the SFML graphics library. It simulates the dynamic interactions of particles under various physical forces, such as gravity and collision, and also includes user interaction capabilities. The simulation can efficiently handle up to a thousand particles, making it a fascinating demonstration of physics in a virtual environment.

## Features

- **Real-time particle collision detection and response.**
- **Simulation of gravity and air resistance effects.**
- **Interactive particle repulsion in response to mouse movements.**
- **Customizable particle attributes**, including mass, radius, and color.
- **Visual representation of particle dynamics and interactions.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **SFML library installed and configured in Visual Studio**

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
2. **Open the solution file** (`.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.
3. **Ensure SFML is properly configured** in your Visual Studio project settings.
4. **Build and run the project** from within Visual Studio.

## Usage

Once you run the executable, the particle simulation will start. You can interact with the simulation using your mouse. The particles will move away from the mouse cursor, simulating repulsion.

### Customizing the Simulation

To tailor the simulation to your preferences, you can modify parameters such as:

- `countParticles` - Adjusts the number of particles in the simulation.
- Particle properties like `radius`, `mass`, and `color` in the particle generation loop.

## Contributing

Your contributions to improve or enhance the simulation are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request with your improvements.
